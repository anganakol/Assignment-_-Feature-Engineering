What is a parameter?\n","\n","ans- Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population parameter based on sample data. It involves formulating a hypothesis about the population, collecting data, and then using statistical tests to determine whether the data supports or rejects the hypothesis.\n","\n","2. What is correlation? What does negative correlation mean?\n","\n","ans- Correlation measures the statistical relationship between two variables. It quantifies how strongly two variables are related and the direction of that relationship.\n","\n","Negative correlation means that two variables move in opposite directions. When one variable increases, the other tends to decrease, and vice versa. For example, there might be a negative correlation between the number of hours spent studying and the number of errors on an exam.\n","\n","3. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n","\n","ans- Machine Learning is a field of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.\n","\n","Data\n","Features\n","Algorithms\n","Model\n","Evaluation\n","\n","4. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n","\n","ans- The loss value quantifies how well the model's predictions match the actual values in the data. A lower loss value generally indicates a better-performing model.\n","\n","5. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n","\n","ans- Continuous Variables: Can take on any value within a given range (e.g., temperature, height, weight).\n","Categorical Variables: Can take on a limited number of values (e.g., color, gender, country).\n","\n","6. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n","\n","ans- Encoding: We need to convert categorical variables into numerical representations that the model can understand. Common techniques include:\n","One-Hot Encoding: Creates a new binary column for each category.\n","Label Encoding: Assigns a unique integer to each category.\n","Ordinal Encoding: Assigns an integer based on the order of the categories.\n","\n","7. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n","\n","ans- Training Data: Used to train the model and teach it to identify patterns and relationships.\n","Testing Data: Used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and assess its ability to generalize.\n","\n","8. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n","\n","ans- sklearn.preprocessing is a submodule in the scikit-learn library in Python that provides tools for data preprocessing, such as scaling, encoding, and normalization.\n","\n","9. What is a Test set?\n","\n","ans- The test set is a portion of the data that is held back during the training process. It is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data to assess its ability to generalize.\n","\n","10. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n","\n","ans- We can use the train_test_split() function from the sklearn.model_selection module. This function randomly splits the data into training and testing sets with a specified ratio (e.g., 80% for training and 20% for testing).\n","\n","11. Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n","\n","ans- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is crucial for understanding the data and identifying potential issues before building a model. It helps in:\n","Identifying patterns, trends, and relationships.\n","Detecting outliers and anomalies.\n","Handling missing values.\n","Selecting appropriate features for the model.\n","\n","12. What is correlation?\n","\n","ans- Correlation measures the statistical relationship between two variables. It quantifies how strongly two variables are related and the direction of that relationship.\n","\n","13. What does negative correlation mean?\n","\n","ans- Negative correlation means that two variables move in opposite directions. When one variable increases, the other tends to decrease, and vice versa.\n","\n","14. How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n","\n","ans- Use the corr() method in pandas to calculate the correlation matrix between variables in a DataFrame.\n","\n","15. What is causation? Explain the difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n","\n","ans- Causation implies that one variable directly causes a change in another.\n","\n","Correlation simply indicates a relationship between two variables, but it doesn't necessarily mean that one causes the other.\n","\n","Example: Ice cream sales and drowning deaths are often correlated. However, eating ice cream does not cause people to drown. The correlation is likely due to a third factor: warm weather.\n","\n","16. What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.\n","\n","ans- Optimizer: An algorithm that adjusts the model's parameters to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance.\n","Types:\n","Gradient Descent: Iteratively adjusts parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the loss function.\n","Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): Similar to gradient descent, but uses a single data point or a small batch of data to update parameters.\n","Adam: A more advanced optimizer that combines the benefits of other optimizers like AdaGrad and RMSprop.\n","\n","17. What is sklearn.linear_model?\n","\n","ans- sklearn.linear_model is a submodule in scikit-learn that provides implementations of various linear models, such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Ridge Regression.\n","\n","18. What does model.fit() do? What arguments must be given?\n","\n","ans- model.fit() trains the machine learning model on the given training data.\n","Arguments typically include the training data features (X_train) and the corresponding target variable (y_train).\n","\n","19. What does model.predict() do? What arguments must be given?\n","\n","ans- model.predict() makes predictions on new, unseen data using the trained model.\n","The argument is usually the feature data for which we want to make predictions (X_test).\n","\n","20. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n","\n","ans- Continuous Variables: Can take on any value within a given range (e.g., temperature, height, weight).\n","Categorical Variables: Can take on a limited number of values (e.g., color, gender, country).\n","\n","21. What is feature scaling? How does it help in Machine Learning?\n","\n","ans- Feature scaling is the process of transforming the features of the data to a common scale.\n","It helps in:\n","Improving model performance by preventing features with larger values from dominating the learning process.\n","Ensuring that all features contribute equally to the model.\n","Making the model more robust to outliers.\n","\n","22. How do we perform scaling in Python?\n","\n","ans-  Use the StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, or RobustScaler classes from the sklearn.preprocessing module.\n","\n","23. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n","\n","ans- sklearn.preprocessing is a submodule in scikit-learn that provides tools for data preprocessing, such as scaling, encoding, and normalization.\n","\n","24.
